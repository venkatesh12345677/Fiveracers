# Fiveracers

/*Lab 1.2)Five Bikers Compete in a race such that they drive at a constant speed which 

may or may not be the same as the other. To qualify the race, the speed of a 

racer must be more than the average speed of all 5 racers. Take as input the 

speed of each racer and print back the speed of qualifying racers.*/
